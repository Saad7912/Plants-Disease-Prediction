# Plants-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict plant diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. A web application has been developed using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users to upload plant images and receive predictions on the presence of diseases.1

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of plants, categorized into healthy and various diseased classes. Ensure the dataset is properly organized before training the model.

# Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for image classification. The model architecture includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

# Web Application
The web application is built using Streamlit. Users can upload plant images, and the application will display the prediction results.

# Results
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting plant diseases. Detailed results and model evaluation metrics can be found in the results directory.
